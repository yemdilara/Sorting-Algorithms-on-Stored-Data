# Sorting Algorithms on Stored Data

## Project Description
This project aims to implement file operations and sorting algorithms in a programming language. The main goal is to create a file containing randomly generated numerical data and apply various sorting algorithms to sort the data efficiently.

## Tasks
1. Create a file containing at least 1000 randomly generated numbers. The file format should be `.txt`, with each number on a separate line.
2. Develop a program to read the data from the file and sort it using different sorting algorithms.
3. Implement the following sorting algorithms:
   - Selection Sort
   - Insertion Sort
   - Merge Sort
4. Measure the sorting time for each algorithm and compare the results to evaluate their performance.

## Technologies Used
- File Handling: Reading and writing files
- Sorting Algorithms: Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort
